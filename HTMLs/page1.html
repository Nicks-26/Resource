                Analysis of Current Political Issues in the Philippines
            </h2>

            <p>
                Politics in the Philippines is an ever-evolving situation. It has experienced various changes in the past few decades, from the rule of Emilio Aguinaldo to the current administration led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his vice president, Sarah Duterte.

            <p>
                The Senate is also a major player in Philippine politics, as it is responsible for passing laws and overseeing government activities. The current political landscape of the Philippines is complex and ever-changing, making it difficult for citizens to stay informed about whatâ€™s going on. However, understanding politics in the Philippines can help people make sense of the current situation and prepare for any future developments.

                The past administration of Rodrigo Duterte has been marked by extrajudicial killings, a controversial policy that has been strongly criticized by many human rights groups. These killings have been linked to the president's "war on drugs" campaign, which has resulted in thousands of deaths since he took office in 2016.

            <p>
                Rodrigo Duterte was the 16th President of the Philippines and served from 2016 to 2021. During his term, he was known for his controversial policies, including the extrajudicial killings that occurred during his administration. This led to the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into whether Duterte had links to these extrajudicial killings.

            <p>
                The ICC's investigation of Duterte's past administration focused on whether there were any links between him and the extrajudicial killings that occurred in his country. It also looked into how effectively the government had prevented such crimes and whether or not it had taken any steps to address them. The investigation ultimately concluded that there was evidence linking Duterte to some of these killings, though it did not find enough evidence to prove a direct link between him and all of them.

                Enough of the killings, let's talk about CORRUPTION.

                Corruption has been a major problem in the Philippines for many years, and it continues to be a major issue today. Politicians have been accused of misusing public funds and resources, while government agencies have been subject to allegations of bribery and embezzlement. Political dynasties, or families that control multiple positions in the government, have also been accused of using their influence to further their interests. This article will discuss the prevalence of corruption in the Philippine government and how it affects citizens.
