                    Here  are some factors to consider if you will buy your bike.
                </p>

                        Determine Your Experience. Some motorcycles are truly meant for experienced riders who are used to road challenges. So, first things first, before you go to the shop, try to determine what you can and cannot do when driving a motorcycle.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Identify Your Needs. Why do you need a motorcycle? As a matter of fact, why do you even want it? Motorcycles come in different shapes and sizes, accommodating the type of travel the rider will most likely use them for, such as long out-of-town travels, city driving, or zigzagging traffic. Always look for a motorcycle that will cater to your needs and see how choosing your bike can become more manageable.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Know Your Options. Through years of innovations, motorcycles have become incredibly diverse and riders have numerous options to choose from that will help them journey on any form of terrain on any period. It is important to know the different options so that you can pick which one suits you best.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Choose A Good Fit. Motorcycles come in different shapes and sizes, but so does the rider. One of the most important factors when riding a bike is balance, which you will find challenging to do if you struggle to ride, simply because your feet cannot reach the foot pegs, or the bike is too heavy. Try to consider some of these parts, as well.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Seat Height and Cushioning – Always measure the height of your seat to see if your feet can touch the motorcycle's foot pegs or the ground, and since there will be a chance that you will ride for hours, check the cushioning of the seat to ensure you won't encounter any chronic injuries.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Engine Heat and Vibration – You will literally be on top of the engine when you are riding your motorcycle. The engine's heat and vibrations can make it uncomfortable for the rider to properly drive a bike in the long run, so make it a point to check the engine.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Weight – Weight is a big part of the rider's ability to balance and drive a motorcycle. There will be times when you will be pushing or pulling the bike to maneuver it, and it can be hazardous to turn when riding a motorcycle that is too heavy for you.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Budget. Motorcycles are great long-term investments, and you should not only consider the retail price of the bike but also the cost of fuel and maintenance. Look for motorcycles that are budget-friendly when it comes to their parts and fuel efficiency.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Owning a motorcycle can be an exciting and cost-effective way of transportation. However, the cost of owning a motorcycle in the Philippines can vary depending on the type and model of bike you choose. In addition to that, there are also costs associated with regular maintenance and repairs. We will look at common maintenance tasks such as changing oil, replacing spark plugs, and checking tire pressure. We will also discuss other costs associated with owning a bike such as insurance, registration fees, and fuel costs. With this information, you can ensure that your motorcycle remains reliable for many years to come without breaking the bank.

                A motorcycle in the Philippines can cost anywhere from ₱50,000 to ₱1,000,000. The price of a motorcycle will depend on the make and model of the motorcycle, as well as any accessories or add-ons that are included with the purchase.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Here are some ways you can do to keep your motorcycle in tip top shape for years.
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Check the tire condition regularly. You should change the tires when you notice a change in the way the bike handles, as specified by local legislation, or at the very latest when the tread is worn down to the wear bars. Under-inflated tires will overheat and may fail. Over-inflated tires will give less than optimal grip.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Check and top up or replace engine oil. It lubricates your gears and engines; not changing the engine oil will cause damage to the engine. The owner's manual will specify how frequently the oil should be changed and this schedule should be followed.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Always keep the air filter clean. Dusty conditions in particular will clog up the filter in very little time.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Adjust the clutch correctly as needed. It should have the right amount of free play.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Service your engine regularly. Tune it up to keep the engine running like clockwork and reduce your fuel consumption.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Maintain the transmission system. If your bike chain is not lubricated, it may be damaged due to excess heat and will wear out. This cumulative wear on all the separate links makes the chain lose, and more likely to fall off the sprockets. This can be very dangerous.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Clean the bike regularly. Keeping it clean of dirt (and salt in winter) will not only make it look nice but will help with maintenance, too.[8] It also makes it easier to notice missing or loose bolts and nuts.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Maintain your brakes.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Motorcycles are a great way to get around, but they can also be dangerous if proper safety precautions are not taken. When riding a motorcycle, it is important to wear the proper safety gear and follow all traffic laws. Additionally, riders should be aware of their surroundings and take extra care when riding in inclement weather or in high-traffic areas. By taking these steps, riders can ensure their safety while using a motorcycle.
